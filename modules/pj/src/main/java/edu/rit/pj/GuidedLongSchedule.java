/**
 * Class GuidedLongSchedule provides a self-guided schedule object. The loop
 * index is type <code>long</code>. The loop iterations are apportioned into chunks
 * of exponentially diminishing sizes. Each successive chunk's size is half the
 * remaining number of iterations divided by the number of threads in the
 * parallel team. However, each chunk is at least a given minimum size (a given
 * minimum number of iterations per chunk). Each parallel team thread repeatedly
 * performs the next available chunk of iterations until there are no more
 * chunks. The final chunk may be smaller than the given minimum chunk size.
